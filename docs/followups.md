## 1. Edit the Supabase email template

Customize the "Confirm signup" auth email so it doesn't look like a
generic Supabase email.

**Where:** Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Email Templates →
*Confirm signup*. Rewrite HTML/subject; use template variables like
`{{ .ConfirmationURL }}` and `{{ .Token }}`.

**Sender domain:** stays `noreply@mail.app.supabase.io` until custom
SMTP is configured. Supabase Auth → SMTP Settings can point at Resend
(reuse the same Resend account `send-campaign` / `sending-domain`
already use).

**Limitation:** one global template — Supabase Auth runs before the
user has a gym, so it can't be per-gym branded from the dashboard
alone. For per-gym branding the proper fix is the Send Email Hook
path (Path C from chat) — render the email in an edge function and
send via Resend with the gym's brand pulled from `user_metadata`.
